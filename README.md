## Kirby + Vue.js Starterkit

### Key Features

- ⚡️ [Vue 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) & [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- 🛣 Automatic routing
- 📦 [On-demand components auto importing](./src/components/)
- 📑 [Nuxt-inspired module system](./src/modules/)
- 🔍 SEO-friendly: [server-side generated](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-extended/blob/main/docs/meta.md) meta tags
- 🌐 [Multi-language](#multi-language) support
- ♿ Accessible frontend routing
- 🚝 [Offline-first](#caching--offline-capability-with-service-worker)
- 💫 [Stale-while-revalidate](#stale-while-revalidate) page data

### Heads Up: Another Boilerplate Available

The [Kirby + Vue.js Lightkit](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-vue-lightkit) is a simpler version of this boilerplate, which you might be interested in for smaller, less complex projects. Since routing is defined inside your SPA, rather than Kirby, another set of features awaits:

- 🗂 [File-based routing](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-vue-lightkit/tree/main/src/pages) like Nuxt.js
- 📑 [Layout system](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-vue-lightkit/tree/main/src/layouts)
- 🎨 [Windi CSS](https://github.com/windicss/windicss) – Next generation utility-first CSS framework
- 😃 [Use icons from any icon sets, with no compromise](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-icons)

### Introduction

> [Or jump right to the setup](#setup).

This boilerplate is a tight and comprehensive integration of [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) in the frontend and [Kirby](https://getkirby.com) as headless CMS. The content is provided as JSON through Kirby and fetched by the frontend.

## Caching & Offline Capability With Service Worker

Even without a service worker installed, the frontend will store pages between individual routes/views. When the tab get reloaded, the data for each page is freshly fetched from the API once again.

For offline capability of your Vue app, you can choose to activate the included [service worker](src/serviceWorker.js).

A visual explanation of both methods can be found in the following flow chart:

![Caching for Kirby and Vue 3 starterkit](./.github/kirby-vue-3-cache-and-store.png)

The service worker precaches all CSS & JS assets required by the Vue app and caches the data of every requested page. All assets are versioned and served from the service worker cache directly.

Each JSON request will be freshly fetched from the network and saved to the cache. If the user's navigator turns out to be offline, the cached page request will be returned.

## Stale-While-Revalidate

The stale-while-revalidate mechanism for the [`usePage`](src/hooks/usePage.js) hook allows you to respond as quickly as possible with cached page data if available, falling back to the network request if it's not cached. The network request is then used to update the cached page data – which directly affects the view after lazily assigning changes (if any), thanks to Vue's reactivity.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js with npm (only required to build the frontend)
- PHP 7.4+

> Kirby is not a free software. You can try it for free on your local machine but in order to run Kirby on a public server you must purchase a [valid license](https://getkirby.com/buy).

## Setup

### Composer

Kirby-related dependencies are managed via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) and located in the `vendor` directory. Install them with:

```bash
composer install
```

### Node Dependencies

Install npm dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

### Environment Variables

Duplicate the [`.env.development.example`](.env.development.example) as `.env`::

```bash
cp .env.development.example .env
```

Optionally, adapt it's values.

### Static assets

_During development_ Kirby can't access static files located in the `src` folder. Therefore it's necessary to create a symbolic link inside of the public folder:

```bash
ln -s $PWD/src/assets ./public/assets
```

## Usage

### Build Mode

During development a `.lock` file will be generated inside the `src` directory to let the backend now it runs in development mode. This file is deleted when running the build command.

> ℹ️ Alternatively, you can set a `KIRBY_MODE` env variable containing either `development` or `production` to set the app mode programmatically and overwrite the `.lock` file mechanism. This may ease setups with Docker.

### Development

You can start the development process with:

```bash
# Runs `npm run kirby` parallel to `vite`
npm run dev
```

Afterwards visit the app in your browser: [`http://127.0.0.1:8080`](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

> For Valet users: Of course you can use a virtual host alternatively!

Vite is used in combination with [backend integration](https://vitejs.dev/guide/backend-integration.html) and only serves frontend assets, not the whole app. Thus, `http://localhost:3000` won't be accessible.

The backend is served by the PHP built-in web server on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default, but you can adapt the location in your `.env` file.

### Production

Build optimized frontend assets to `public/dist`:

```bash
npm run build
```

Vite will generate a hashed version of all assets, including images and fonts saved inside `src/assets`. It will further create a `manifest.json` file with hash records etc.

### Deployment

> ℹ️ See [ploi-deploy.sh](./scripts/ploi-deploy.sh) for exemplary deployment instructions.

> ℹ️ Some hosting environments require to uncomment `RewriteBase /` in [`.htaccess`](public/.htaccess) to make site links work.

## Configuration

All development and production related configurations for both backend and frontend code are located in your `.env` file:

- `KIRBY_DEV_HOSTNAME` and `KIRBY_DEV_PORT` specify the address where you wish the Kirby backend to be served from. It is used by the frontend to fetch content data as JSON.
- Keys starting with `VITE_` are available in your code following the `import.meta.env.VITE_CUSTOM_VARIABLE` syntax.

For example, setting `KIRBY_CACHE` to `true` is useful in production environment.

### Content API Slug

To change the API slug to fetch JSON-encoded page data from, set

- `CONTENT_API_SLUG` to a value of your liking (defaults to `spa`). It can even be left empty to omit a slug altogether!

> You can't use Kirby's internal API slug (defaults to `api`). If you insist on using `api` for _your_ content endpoint, you can rename Kirby's by adding a `KIRBY_API_SLUG` key and set it to something other than `api`.

### Multi-Language

Multiple languages are supported. A comprehensive introduction about [multi-language setups](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/languages/introduction) may be found on the Kirby website.

To enable language handling, you don't have to edit the [`config.php`](site/config/config.php) manually. Just set

- `KIRBY_MULTILANG` to `true`.
- `KIRBY_MULTILANG_DETECT` to `true` (optional but recommended).

Then, visit the panel and add new languages by your liking. The Panel **automatically renames all existing content** and file meta data files and includes the language extension.

Language data is provided by the global `site` object, which can be accessed via the `useSite()` hook.

### Service Worker

To enable the **service worker** which precaches essential assets and page API calls for offline capability, set:

- `VITE_SERVICE_WORKER` to `true`

> ⚠️ Don't change the `CONTENT_API_SLUG` once you deployed your app publicly and thus a service worker is installed on clients. Otherwise fetch requests will fail and a blank page will show until the new service worker is activated, which then is only possible by closing the tab/PWA.

### Stale-While-Revalidating

To keep page data fresh with **stale-while-revalidate**, set:

- `VITE_STALE_WHILE_REVALIDATE` to `true`
